      <h2>Plot</h2>
      <p>
        Mei first encounters the small Totoro, followed by his medium companion, while running around the house's yard and spotting their acorns. She follows them into the forest where she discovers Totoro taking a nap. Although he is clearly surprised by her presence, he ultimately lets her fall asleep on his chest.

  Later, he arrives at the same bus stop where Mei and Satsuki are waiting for their father. He wears a simple leaf to protect him from the rain: Satsuki gives him their father's umbrella. Totoro is intrigued by the sound of rain dripping from the trees landing on the umbrella, and even playfully jumps on the ground to cause more to fall. Eventually, the Catbus arrives to take him on his way. Before he leaves, he gives Mei a gift of acorns wrapped in bamboo leaf for the girls to plant.

    <h2>Other Totoros</h2>
    <p>
      Sometime later, he leads the other Totoros in a song and dance to make the acorns the girls planted grow. They are joined by Mei and Satsuki. He then invites them on a ride on his magical flying top, which they use to fly to the top of the trees and play his acorn flute.

  When Mei gets lost trying to get to the hospital, Satsuki seeks out Totoro and asks for his help in rescuing her. Totoro gladly obliges, summoning the Catbus and sending Satuski off with it to find Mei.

  He is last seen playing the flute while observing Mei and Satsuki's return home
